<h1>Richard Crispo Educational Proposal</h1>

<h2>OVER ALL OBJECTIVE</h2>
 
<p>Learn what goes into writing general programing with the skills to design sites with the user experience and user interface in mind.</p>

Gain the knowledge to design website understanding the UI/UX platforms and the skills to know how to develop a user-friendly site. My UI/UX skills will also help me with analytics, user flow, interface and experience etc.

Speaking with my instructor my learning will be in 3 parts. My instruction for the most part will be one on one with online instructions when needed.

The summary of my education will involve:


1. Front End Basics
  a. HTML5 markup ("nouns")
  b. CSS3 styling ("adjectives")
  c. JavaScript and jQuery scripts ("sentences")
  d. General programing concepts/skills: developer tools, dev environments, version control, specificity, preprocessors, etc.

2. Back End Basics
  a. PHP working with servers, databases, and dynamic data
  b. {Instructor need to know how much I need to learn in this area. }

3. Big Picture Work
  a. Working with various libraries or incorporating plugins
  b. Working with Content Management systems, subdomains, etc.
  c. Integrating marketing strategy in web development

Part I establishes some basic coding literacy, so I can get into code, fix, and build things myself. I'll also learn common contemporary conventions and principles along the way in this part (making my markup semantic, making CSS modular, etc). The goal in this part is to get a handle on the basic frontend rudiments everyone needs down in order to work with web sites. This makes up about 80% of what I will need to know in order to make changes myself or talk with other developers I might work with on UI/UX things.

Part II

Once I get a full grasp of Part 1 I will get into Part II JavaScript and the PHP, I am told this is where things get a little more technical. Having this knowledge will help learn on my own to take my education as far as I want to.


Through my education I also will want to learn PHP (it's everywhere), and will help me understand the server-side languages. When it comes to server-side languages, and I'll tailor things accordingly.

Part III

Some of the concepts in Part III can be peppered throughout, but this is also where things can go in many different directions. This section involves learning more about marketing tools? Working with design, layouts, photography, etc? This is where I can learn more coding-specific, especially when it comes to libraries or frameworks if IT will be working in (ex. Bootstrap, Angular, React, Rails, etc.).

Apart from my educational training I will be researching developer blogs and articles. Once I get a the understanding of the web language I will continue my training on sites like Tree House, teamtreehouse.com  and Codeacademy  codeacadmy.com.

MANAGING EXPECTATIONS

Timeline from November to January Part I and II all coinciding with Part III

I am told I would get a full grasp of Part 1 will take a month of tutoring and applied instruction. I will learn the Front End Basics, which will enable me to talk with other UI/UX developers.

Part II will take a month or a little longer and will enable me to read code and write code where I can feel confident knowing how to recognize where to rewrite code for changes.

Part III

As mention in my summary this lesion begins in Part I and as I understand more knowledge I Part III coincides with my learning

Cost for my training

My instructor has an hourly rate of $50 and hr.
I believe most of my training is my diligence to practice, practice and practice what I am taught.  Then apply my lessons on real assignments. My total time would be about 40 hours at a cost of $2,000. Anything over I will pay on my own.

Educational summary

I recognize this is the direction where all Marketing is headed. I realize the need to stay relevant and learn a skill that will be valuable and useful to our department and the university. Through my education I fully understand this is a requirement for me to keep my job and gain the respect and confidence of the people I work with. My motivation will be I am learning another skill that will enhance my design skills and digital knowledge.  Increase my production to the department while adding the knowledge to develop work that gets favorable results.
